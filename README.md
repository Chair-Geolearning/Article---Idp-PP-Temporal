Code of the Article - Analyzing temporal dependence between extreme events using point processes
Abstract : Extreme meteorological events often occur in complex temporal configurations, where the impacts of one hazard may depend on the prior occurrence of others. Characterising such temporal dependencies is essential for understanding compound climate risks, yet remains challenging due to the discrete, heterogeneous, and clustered nature of extreme events. In this study, we apply temporal point process methods to characterise dependencies among extreme meteorological events occurring within appropriately defined spatial regions across Europe, focusing exclusively on their temporal structure.

We introduce an event-based framework in which extreme events are represented as marked temporal point processes, with marks describing key characteristics such as intensity or duration. Global first- and second-order temporal statistics are used to quantify clustering, co-occurrence, and directional dependencies between different types of extremes. In particular, we rely on directional cross-$K$ functions to assess whether the occurrence of one type of extreme event systematically modifies the short-term probability of subsequent events of another type.

Two complementary applications illustrate different facets of compound event analysis. First, we demonstrate the relevance of the framework for preconditioned compound events through a temporal analysis of wildfire-related meteorological extremes. Second, we examine temporal dependence between extreme precipitation, extreme wind, and extreme atmospheric instability across all European NUTS-2 regions. 

Building on these second-order statistics, we develop formal tests of temporal independence to assess the significance of observed directional interactions between different types of extreme events. Overall, this temporal point process framework provides a rigorous and interpretable approach to the analysis of compound and preconditioned climate extremes, with direct applications to climate risk assessment and early-warning systems.
